# Telecom_customer_churn_prediction
The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project is aimed at predicting whether a customer will churn or not from a telecom company based on various factors such as their demographic information, usage patterns, and customer service interactions. The dataset used for this project contains information about customers and their behavior over a four-month period.

The project follows a typical machine learning workflow, starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and its features. Various visualization techniques are used to analyze the distribution of variables, relationships between variables, and potential outliers. Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are then applied to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.

After the data has been preprocessed, the project then moves on to feature selection and engineering, where relevant features are selected and new features are created based on domain knowledge or statistical analysis. The selected features are then used to train several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting classifiers.

The models are evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and their performance is compared to select the best performing model. Once the best model has been selected, it is used to predict the churn probability for new customers based on their input data.

Finally, the project concludes with recommendations and insights for the telecom company based on the analysis and predictions made during the project. Overall, this project provides a practical example of how machine learning techniques can be used to predict customer churn and provides useful insights for businesses looking to improve customer retention.The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project is aimed at predicting
